<h1>Firestorm – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>
In the grand tradition of the Internet, we will attempt to answer questions
on this page.
"Frequently" will mean "at least once."
Feel free to get your questions to us however you choose, and as answers
appear on this page, we will do our best to notify you.
</p>

<p>
In a break with tradition, we intend to allow you to ask questions here
as well as come here for answers.
This will, of course, be implemented using Firestorm, as time permits.
Thanks to 
<a href=mailto:brileigh@ozemail.com.au>Brian Hancock</a>
for the first seven questions.
And to <a href=mailto:w.j.reilly@worldnet.att.net>Bill Reilly</a> for 8 and 9.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
1. "the compile lines in the http://www.sanbachs.net/firestorm/usage.html
page, make reference to the pba.o object file , for example:
<pre>
  gcc -o fs-xxxxx pba.o ../dp.o ../map.o ../dpif.o ../engine.o ../dot.o
</pre>
</p>

<p>
however the Makefile does not create a pba.o so I changed reference to the
pba.o to the pba.c generated from the Metad app, and everything worked
smoothly. Was that a typo or did I miss the creation of the pba object file?"
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
1. the only Makefile we've distributed so far is the one for the Firestorm
code itself. Here is what we usually do. As suggested elsewhere, we
create one subdirectory of the fs directory for each database (using
the five character abbreviation as the directory name). In this 
subdirectory, we place a Makefile specific to the database, such as,
for example, this <a href=demo/Makefile>Makefile</a> from the 
<a href=demo.html>demo database</a>.
</p>

<p>
The first two lines of the Makefile (repeated here for your convenience)
define ENGINE_OBJS to be a list of object files, and FS_OBJS to be a
slightly longer list containing the former.
<pre>
  ENGINE_OBJS = pba.o ../dpif.o ../engine.o ../dot.o
  FS_OBJS     = ${ENGINE_OBJS} ../fsMain.o ../fsCore.o
</pre>
</p>

<p>
You'll notice that pba.o is expected to be in the current directory
(the one the Makefile is in, i.e. "fs/demo"), while the other object files
are in the parent directory (i.e. "fs"), and have been previously made
using <i>its</i> Makefile.
</p>

<p>
Your solution also makes the pba.o file, because the gcc command is
able to recognize (by the ".c" file extension) that the pba.c file
needs compiling.
</p>

<p>
While in the "fs/demo" directory, with this 
<a href=demo/Makefile>Makefile</a> in place, issuing the command
<pre>
  make fs-demo
</pre>
will construct the command line interface program (named "fs-demo") for
the demo database. And the command
<pre>
  make demo
</pre>
will construct all of the demo*.cgi programs.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
2. "The command line interface seems to have a richer set of methods than the
programatic interface, eg, add, edit, update and delete. Does the
programmatic interface have these?"
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
2. Yes. These will be documented soon. In the meantime, see the 
<a href=demo.html>demonstration</a> example programs for some of them.
</p>

<p><a name=3><strong>Question</strong></a>
3. "All the CGI examples are in C, using the programmatic interface (PI)
rather than in Perl using the command line interface (CLI)? Is there a
reason for this? Does anyone have any Perl scripts that they could share to
help the learning?"
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>

3. There's always a reason ;-).
Historically, we worked with Perl before working with C.
This was five years ago, when we had the competent help of 
<a href=mailto:thom@xmission.com>Thom Boyer</a>, who
prefers using Perl.
Most of the work in the last three and a half years has been done in C.
</p>

<p>
Rather than supplying any specific Perl scripts, try adding the report
which we used to <a href=Perl/report.ste>generate Perl scripts</a>
to your METAD database.
You will need to create a record in panel 6 of METAD to describe the
environment in which these Perl scripts will be executed.
The generated scripts require <a href=Perl/lib_pl.txt>lib.pl</a>, which
is a Perl CGI library written by Thom.
A more detailed explanation of all of this will be 
<a href=perl.html>forthcoming</a>.
</p>

<p>
In working with the CGI scripts in general, the Perl script
<a href=Perl/status_pl.txt>status.pl</a> is a wonderful help in understanding
the Common Gateway Interface (CGI).
Install it in a directory from which your web server will execute Perl
scripts and try using it with various URL's 
and HTML forms to see what kind of information
is passed from the browser to CGI scripts.
You can also <a href=http://www.sanbachs.net/cgi-bin/status.pl>use it directly
on our web server</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
4. "When using the CLI for add, edit, update, delete are the locking
mechanisms that we would be used to in DP still observed?"
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
4. Yes.
In particular, error codes are returned to indicate some of the things
that can happen in connection with the locking mechanisms of DP.
For example, code 802 means the record was changed by another user
on the network.
One of the beauties of using Firestorm with DP databases is that web
applications can share the same database files with users of the
classic DataPerfect.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
5. "The FS-xxxx application on a Linux system seems to expects the xxxx.str,
xxxx.ind, data etc to be within the same directory, on the same system.
Given that applications I would like to web enable would generally be
sitting on a Netware server for multiple LAN connected PC users, what
strategies if any could be employed to make that data available to the
FS-xxxx application running on the Linux box."
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
5. There are two separate questions. See also the answer to question 7, which
is related.
The pba.c file indicates the names of the datafiles.
The .str file is <strong>not</strong> used by Firestorm, but the .ind, .txx,
and panel data files are.
Theoretically, you could put a path name in front of the filenames in
the pba.c file and Firestorm would look for them there.
We have never done this, but it should work.
The only complication is for the panel data files.
Consider these lines from the demo pba.c file (which give, respectively,
the filenames "demo.001", "demo.ind", and "demo.txx"):
<pre>
  ...
  8, 'd', 'e', 'm', 'o', '.', '0', '0', '1',
  ...
  char *ind_name = "demo.ind";
  char *txx_name = "demo.txx";
  ...
</pre>
While it is fairly obvious how to add a path name, for the .ind and .txx 
files, the panel data filenames are given character by character, and
the characters are preceded by the total length of the filename.
For example, if the database files were in the path "/dp/", these
lines from the demo pba.c file might be changed to look like:
<pre>
  ...
  12, '/', 'd', 'p', '/', 'd', 'e', 'm', 'o', '.', '0', '0', '1',
  ...
  char *ind_name = "/dp/demo.ind";
  char *txx_name = "/dp/demo.txx";
  ...
</pre>
You must be very careful to get the length right, or the engine will
fail in mysterious and unpredictable ways.
Ensuring that the pba.c file is correct is the main reason we generate it
using a DP report, rather than trying to build it by hand.
It may be worth modifying the report rather than making these changes 
by hand.
</p>

<p>
After making this change, of course, the pba.c file will need to be
recompiled, and any executables including it relinked.
If someone tries this, please let us all know how it works.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
6. "What security do the PI and CLI interface offer? I would normally use
User ID's and menu's to provide some security for the application? The
possibility of some web users deleting or updating data from the application
is a little frightening? Eg malformed information requests?"
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
6. There are no security mechanisms built in to these interfaces.
We intend to document some of the things we have done in this regard, but
this has not been a priority.
</p>

<p>
The User ID panel and menus are just two of the features of DataPerfect
that are not present in the Firestorm engine. Others that you will miss
are computed fields and keep-a-total.
We are hoping that Firestorm will generate enough interest and revenue to
fund the development of a more powerful engine that would encompass many
more features of DataPerfect.
</p>

<p>
The danger you indicate is very real.
Great care must be taken in writing CGI scripts that modify or delete
(or even create) records, so that (unintentional or malicious)
malformed requests cannot cause damage.
Mostly, our scripts do not allow changes to the underlying database.
A notable exception to this is our guest book, and there we have found that
we need to exercise editorial control by removing offensive entries.
</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
7. "The sort of scenario I have in mind: Web pages sitting on a high
availability, large bandwidth server at a web host. This web host supporting
CGI, generally through Perl. One aspect of the web site being say client
orders, or requests for information from a DP application running on a
Netware or NT server at my client's premises, connected fulltime to the
internet through a lower speed internet connection, eg permanent dial up,
with a firewall of some type. Is this a realistic project for Firestorm?"
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
7. This may or may not be realistic.
Some of our applications duplicate the client's database on our web server.
In this case updates are done periodically, 
and the work can range from completely
overwriting the old files with new ones to importing a transaction log.
Other applications are hosted by a web server running on the same NT
machine that contains the database for use through the LAN with the
classic DataPerfect user interface.
<p>

<p>
Both of these scenarios have worked well over the years.
What you are suggesting is different and has not been attempted.
A little background is in order here.
Most commercial database mangement systems use a client/server architecture.
</p>

<p>
It is a little known fact that DataPerfect is also client/server.
Let me explain.
A few years ago, when WordPerfect Office released their web-based email
solution, they called it a "zero byte client."
This was because they had discovered the marvel of programming for the web,
which is that you don't have to write any client software to the baroque Windows
interface. Also, because the client is provided for you (it is simply
the web browser) you don't have to worry about porting your client software
to other platforms, such as the Macintosh, etc.
Again, this is provided by others.
Also, your users don't have to install your client software, because they
have already done so.
</p>

<p>
DataPerfect has a "zero byte <i>server</i>" which is, simply, the shared file
system. This is provided by others, the file server vendors.
All that ships with DataPerfect is the client side.
Your users have already installed the server side, and furthermore, 
often have IS departments to care for it, besides!
This is an unsung part of the genius of DataPerfect.
If you have ever had to install and manage the server side of a commercial
database system, you will <strong>know</strong> just how brilliant this is
and what a debt of gratitude we all owe to Lew for making our lives easier
and more pleasant!
</p>

<p>
Whenever a piece of software uses the client/server architecture, you have to
pay careful attention to the data communication between the client side and
the server side.
When using the classic DataPerfect, we don't have to worry about it, because
everything works fine (as long as there are no bugs in the file system
itself).
</p>

<p>
With Firestorm, even though the engine is running on a web server, it is 
playing the same "client" role that DataPerfect plays classically.
For this to work properly, the engine and the file server that holds the
database files must communicate using the standard LAN file server
protocols.
These are <strong>not</strong> standard Internet protocols.
</p>

<p>
To my knowledge there are two Internet protocols that can carry the data
required between a DataPerfect client and a file server.
These are NFS (the Network File System), and Samba.
If you set up a Samba server on your customer's machine, you should,
theoretically, be able to not only run Firestorm applications on your
web server, but also
DataPerfect itself (assuming your web server can run DataPerfect--if 
only DP were available for Linux--oh well).
However, you make a point that the customer connection to the Internet would
be slow. Even though DataPerfect (and hence Firestorm) is very efficient
in the traffic it generates with the file system, this traffic is still
considerable, and when wrapped in NFS would perhaps be more than a slow
connection could handle. Perhaps Samba is more efficient.
We investigated NFS at one time, but have not looked into Samba.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
8. "I downloaded a free compiler from the following address:
<address>
<a href=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/>http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/</a>
</address> 
The program expects you to work in terms of 'projects' and I don't know if your source files should be considered one or more projects.  I also don't know what the '.h' files are or what to do with them.
</p>

<p>
What I'm saying here is that I don't know how to compile the source code.  And now that I've been thinking about it, I'm wondering why I need to at all.  Couldn't you just send the executables?"
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
8. You would use a project for each of your databases. Each project would
share the Firestorm files. The .h files are definition files that are
required by the source code files (the .c ones). 
Place them in the same directory with the .c files.
</p>

<p>
We can't just send the executables for two reasons. First, we would have
to make a lot of different ones, as each system has different executable
formats and system libraries, so it's quite a big operation. Second, we
haven't compiled it on a Windows system for a long time, so we don't have
an up to date executable at hand. Besides all that, an executable has to
include the PBA for your database as an integral part of it.
</p>

<p>
In the METAD database, you will need to
run the three reports in order after having imported the .{X} file
produced by METADXP.COM. This will create a file named PBA.C in the
subdirectory for your database. In the project for your database, you
would then include the PBA.C file as one of the project files.
</p>

<p>
Your compiler will produce a .OBJ file for each of the .c
files. All of these will be combined into one .EXE file, which is the
executable. If your database is named, say, PHONE.STR, you would have a
project named phone, and include in it dot.c, engine.c, dpif.c, map.c,
and dp.c, as well as all of the .h files except fs.h. These files would
all be included from the fs directory, whereas your project files would
be in a subdirectory of fs named phone. From the phone subdirectory, you
would include the pba.c file generated by METAD. To do that, you will
have been working in a directory named metad with its own subdirectory
named phone. So, once the pba.c file is generated there, you'll need to
copy it over to the compiler's fs\phone subdirectory. Then have the
project make the executable, and name it fs-phone.exe (still following
the standard Firestorm naming conventions). This will be an executable
<a href=cli.html>command line interface</a> program.
</p>

<p>
When you go to make a CGI script, it will most likely need its own
project (make it a sub-project of the phone project if your compiler has
the concept of sub projects). In this project, include all of the fs
files you included in the phone project (except you must leave out map.c
and dp.c), and also fs.h, fsCore.c, and fsMain.c. Also, the pba.c file
from the phone project. This time you shouldn't need to copy it, but
just have your compiler reach for it where it is located in fs\phone.
Here also, you will include the source file for your CGI script, named,
say, phone-action.c. When you do a build (sometimes called make) of this
project, it will generate an executable which you should have it name
phone-action.exe and is the CGI script for your web server to use.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
9. "I'm also confused about the 5 character limit.  What is happening there?"
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
9. This began long ago with a personal
convention used by one of us, in which DP databases are named with a 5
character name. Then the panel data files are named with
the same name dot 001, 002, etc.
This leaves "room" in the DOS 8.3 naming system for names like
DNAME001.EXP for files created by the built-in short reports whenever a
field needs to be added to panel 001, etc. 
This convention was adopted because when you 
make a <i>lot</i> of DP databases, and they go through a lot of iterations
before they are finalized, it is an easy way to remember all
the file names that are needed. 
Now, we don't mean to impose this
convention on the whole community, but the 5 character limit just got
built in to a lot of assumptions as the Firestorm project unfolded.
We're stuck with it for now. It shouldn't be too much of a constraint.
You don't need to rename your own .STR files, just decide on a 5
character abbreviation and use that inside of METAD and as subdirectory
names. And CGI scripts can have names as long as you want. By
convention, we choose to have them all begin with the 5 character
database name, so that we can keep track of them. But that is not a
requirement for anyone else.
