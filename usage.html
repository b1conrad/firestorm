<h1>Firestorm – Usage Guide</h1>

<!--
<p>
This usage guide is being written right now. Please reload from time to time.
Thank you for your interest and patience!
</p>
-->

<p>
This usage guide documents the way in which Firestorm has been used over the
last four years.
Many of the instructions are based on conventions and are open to change as
more experience is gained, and better ways are found to do things.
Please don't hesitate to 
<a href=mailto:improvements@sanbachs.com?Subject=better-way>suggest 
improvements</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are three directory structures that you will need to set up.
<ol>
<li>METAD and generation of PBA.C files (on a machine that can run DataPerfect)
<li>Firestorm and CGI scripts (on a machine that can generate executables that
will run on your web server)
<li>Web server HTML documents and CGI executables
</ol>

<p>
There are three kinds of work that you will need to do in order to create
a web application based on your DataPerfect database.
Using METAD, which is itself a DataPerfect database (somewhat like the 
<a href=http://www.dataperfect.nl/steman.php3>STE Manager</a>, 
though not nearly as complete), you will create the PBA.C file
that describes your database.
This file contains a small part of the information from your DataPerfect
structure file, in a format suitable for the programmatic interface.
We suggest that you place the METAD database, and the accompanying
METADXP.COM program in a directory named "metad".
The METAD database will produce its output in a subdirectory whose
name is (by default) the first five characters of your database name.
</p>

<p>
The second kind of work you will do is to compile the ANSI C source code
for the Firestorm database engine.
We suggest that you do this work in a directory named "fs".
Again, the CGI scripts that you will write for a particular one of your
databases will be placed in a subdirectory whose name is the
first five characters of your database name (or a five character
abbreviation of your choice).
</p>

<p>
Once you have created and compiled the PBA.C file, and have compiled the
Firestorm source code, and have compiled and linked these with your own
CGI scripts, you will need to copy the executable files into a directory
that can be used by your web server.
So, the third kind of work you have to do is to set up a web server, and
configure it to run CGI scripts.
All of the database files (except the .STR file) will also need to be
copied (or reside permanently) in the directory from which the CGI scripts
are to be run.
</p>

<h2>1. METAD and generation of PBA.C files</h2>
<p>
Unzip md001126.zip in a directory named METAD.
Create the METAD database using DPIMP.COM.
If you followed the instructions in the
<a href=installation.html>installation guide</a>
you will have already performed these steps.
</p>

<p>
For each database you wish to use on the Internet, you will need to follow 
the same steps.
These are given below (using METAD itself as an example).
<ol>
<li>Choose an abbreviation for the database name that is no more than
five characters in length (METAD)
<li>Make a subdirectory of that name (mkdir metad)
<li>Change directories to the new subdirectory (cd metad)
<li>Copy the database structure file from wherever you customarily work on
it to the new subdirectory (copy ..\metad.str .)
<li>Run the program METADXP.COM (..\metadxp) and press Enter when prompted
for the database structure file. This will create a file with a ".{X}"
extension (METAD.{X})
<li>Return to the parent directory (cd ..)
<li>Run DataPerfect on the METAD database (dp metad), at which time you will
see the <a href=images/metad-menu.gif>METAD menu</a>
<li>Type option number 98 and press Enter to see the
<a href=images/metad-panels.gif>METAD panel list</a>
<li>Press Enter to select the "Database Description" panel
<li>Press Shift-F9, select option "8 - Import Transaction Log", and Enter the 
filename (METAD\METAD.{X}). When the import is finished, press any key and you
will see <a href=images/metad-after-import.gif>the results of importing
the file METAD\METAD.{X}</a> (which was created in step 5)
<li>Press F6 to edit, type a 1 (one) to change the database to be number one,
and Tab twice to the Filename field and ensure that the first five characters
of this name match the subdirectory name created in step 2. 
Then press F10 to save the record. There will be a short pause while
the cascade update feature changes the database number in all of the records.
Then you will see <a href=images/metad-after-renumber.gif>the renumbered
record</a> in the Database Description panel
<li>Now press Shift-F7 to see the
<a href=images/metad-reports.gif>report list</a>
<li>Press the down-arrow once to select the report named
"Assign index base blocks" and press Enter. Then press F7 twice to return
to the record, and press Alt-F7 to run the report for this record. Press
any key when the report is finished
<li>Press Shift-F7, then down-arrow to select the report named
"Count fields and indexes" and press Enter. Then press F7 twice to return
to the record, and press Alt-F7 to run the report for this record. Press
any key when the report is finished
<li>At this point, you will see the 
<a href=images/metad-after-count.gif>Database Description record with the
correct number of fields</a> per panel shown in the right hand column
<li>Press Shift-F7, then down-arrow to select the report named
"Generate PBA.C" and press Enter. Then press F7 twice to return to the
record, and press Alt-F7 to run the report for this record. Press any key
when the report is finished. This will create the PBA.C file for the
database (metad\PBA.C). If you see an
<a href=images/metad-error.gif>error screen</a> 
it is probably because you didn't
create a directory name that the report expects (METAD) in step 2 or didn't
edit the Filename field (step 11) 
in the Database Description record so that its first
five characters match the subdirectory name
</ol>

<p>
Repeat steps 1-16 for each database you want to use with Firestorm,
replacing "metad" and "METAD" with your five character abbreviation in
steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, and 16.
Step 11 will need to be changed to give each database its own number, one
for the first, two for the second, and so forth.
If you get to database number 22, you will need to have that one be number
23, as METADXP.COM always produces number 22, and you need to leave that
number free for the import.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you change one of your databases, by adding or removing fields or
indexes, you will need to repeat steps 3-16 to generate a new PBA.C file
that describes it correctly.
You may delete its record in the Database Description panel and reuse the
same number, or give the new version a new number, as you wish.
</p>

<p>
The directory structure for this first kind of work will look something like
the following diagram.
This assumes that you have followed steps 1-16 for the metad.str database
itself, for one of your databases named "phone.str", and for one of your
databases named "contacts.str" for which you have chosen the abbreviation
"cntct".
<pre>
  |
  +-metad
  |   |
  |   +-metad.str (etc.)
  |   +-METADXP.COM
  |   +-metad
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-metad.str
  |   |   +-METAD.{X}
  |   |   +-PBA.C
  |   +-phone
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-phone.str
  |   |   +-PHONE.{X}
  |   |   +-PBA.C
  |   +-cntct
  |       |
  |       +-contacts.str
  |       +-CONTACTS.{X}
  |       +-PBA.C
  |
</pre>

<h2>2. Firestorm and CGI scripts</h2>

<p>
If you have followed the
<a href=installation.html>installation guide</a>
you will have set up a directory named "fs", unzipped one of the Firestorm
source code archives, and compiled the code.
</p>

<p>
This directory should contain the files from the following list.
If you are compiling on a Windows machine, the object files will have
a ".OBJ" extension, rather than the ".o" extension used in UNIX-like systems.
The various files are given in order from the lowest, most central, or
foundational layer first.
<dl>
<dt>dot.c<dd>The foundation of all, this is the Forth engine.
It is accompanied by dot.h, forth.h, and ftable.h, which together
describe certain aspects of the Forth engine.
Another definition file, machine.h, describes certain data types used
throughout.
<dt>engine.c<dd>The C program that interprets the Forth engine. It is
accompanied by engine.h, which describes it for the next level.
This program includes symbols.c, which contains information useful when
debugging is needed at the engine level (neither frequently nor recently).
<dt>dpif.c<dd>The lowest level of the programmatic interface. Its entry
points are described by dpif.h.
All current and future uses of the engine are and will be built on top
of this level.
<dt>dp.c<dd>This implements the
<a href=cli.html>command line interface</a>, using the lower level parts.
It also needs to be linked with the compiled version of map.c, which maps
between the DOS character set and the ISO Latin1 character set used on the web.
A PBA.C file must be linked with this program. 
The structures used are defined in the the definitional file pba.h.
<dt>fsCore.c<dd>This implements the 
<a href=fs.html>programmatic interface</a>. Either dp.c or fsCore.c can
be used with the underlying levels, but not both at the same time.
A PBA.C file must be linked with this program. 
The definitional file fs.h describes the data types and function calls that
together make up the programmatic interface.
<dt>fsMain.c<dd>This provides a main program for CGI scripts. It accepts
input values from a URL or from a form and makes them available to your
CGI program, which must be named "FSquery". See the programmatic interface
<a href=demo.html>demonstration</a> (part five)
for more information, and a working example.
</dl>

<p>
All of the programs described above, together with their .o (or .OBJ)
compiled versions, will reside in the fs directory.
Make a subdirectory of fs, named with your five character abbreviation,
for each of your databases.
Copy into each of these the corresponding PBA.C program, which was generated
by the METAD report.
Compile this program to produce PBA.O (or PBA.OBJ).
</p>

<p>
With all of this done, you are ready to begin making executable programs
for your database.
To make a command line program for your database, link together 
pba.o ../dp.o ../map.o ../dpif.o ../engine.o and ../dot.o to form the
executable program named fs-xxxxx, where "xxxxx" is replaced with your
five character abbreviation.
The command to do this on UNIX-like machines is:
<pre>
  gcc -o fs-xxxxx pba.o ../dp.o ../map.o ../dpif.o ../engine.o ../dot.o
</pre>

<p>
We recommend that you create a subdirectory (of the database-specific
directory) named "Data".
Copy into this directory all of the panel data files, the index file, and
the .TXX file for your database.
One important note here is that the index base blocks must be assigned
the same way in the PBA.C file and your database. 
The simplest way to ensure this is to delete the .IND index file, run
DataPerfect (answering 
"1 - Create a New Index File with New Indexes for All Data Files." 
when prompted) on your database. Then,
go into one of its panels (doesn't matter which one), and answer
"3 - Re-create the Indexes for All Files." when prompted.
This will create a new index file with all of the index blocks allocated
in the same way the PBA.C assumes.
</p>

<p>
Now change into the Data subdirectory and try out the 
<a href=cli.html>command line interface</a> for your database.
</p>

<p>
Now, working in the database-specific subdirectory of fs, you can begin to
create your CGI scripts. Let's say, for example, that you are working with
a contacts database, for which you have chosen the abbreviation "cntct" and
that you are working on a CGI script named "cntct-enter.c" to accept the
data from an HTML form and add a new contact to the database.
Your directory structure will look something like this:
<pre>
  |
  +-fs
  |  |
  |  +-dot.c, dot.o, engine.c, etc.
  |  +-cntct
  |  |   |
  |  |   +-pba.c, pba.o
  |  |   +-fs-cntct
  |  |   +-Data
  |  |   |   |
  |  |   |   +-contacts.txx
  |  |   |   +-contacts.ind
  |  |   |   +-contacts.dat, etc.
  |  |   |
  |  |   +-cntct-enter.c
  |  |   +-cntct-enter.o
  |  |   +-cntct-enter.cgi
  |  |
  |  +-phone
  |      |
  |      +-pba.c, pba.o
  |      +-fs-phone
  |      +-Data
  |          |
  |          +-phone.txx, phone.ind, etc.
</pre>

<p>
The command to compile cntct-enter.c and create cntct-enter.o is, 
on UNIX-like systems:
<pre>
   gcc -c cntct-enter.c
</pre>

<p>
The command to create the executable file, cntct-enter.cgi, is:
<pre>
   gcc -o cntct-enter.cgi cntct-enter.o pba.o \
      ../fsMain.o ../fsCore.o ../dpif.o ../engine.o ../dot.o
</pre>

<p>
Once the executable CGI script has been created, you can test it from the 
command line.
For example, assuming a very simple contact structure, consisting of
Name, Title, and Phone, you might test it like this:
<pre>
  cd Data
  ../cntct-enter.cgi Name=Bob "Title=Mangaging Director" Phone=555-4073
</pre>

<p>
To add the same record using the command line interface would be done this way:
<pre>
  cd Data
  ../fs-cntct p1 a Bob "Managing Director" 555-4073 q
</pre>

<p>
At this point, you are now able to create Firestorm programs to access your
database on a UNIX-like system.
You have a command line interface and the ability to write an unlimited 
number of custom access programs and executable CGI scripts.
The next step is to get these CGI scripts running in conjuction with your
web server, so that you have Internet (or intranet) access to your database.
