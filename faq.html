<h1>Firestorm &ndash; Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>
<a href=faq1.html>Earlier questions</a> remain available.

<p>
Thanks to <a href=mailto:jerom@xs4all.nl>Jeroen Vader</a> 
for questions 10 through 14.
And to <a href=mailto:neutondata@yahoo.com>Larry Neuton</a> for question 15.
Thanks to <a href=mailto:Pieter.Vankeerberghen@afigp.fgov.be>Pieter Vankeerberghen</a> for <a href=#16>question 16</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
10. I understand there's a need to generate the panel byte array
description for an STR, and that the resulting pba.c is then used to
generate a separate executable for every database. How difficult would
it be, in your opinion, to write a general executable instead, and then
have the database definition (the STR) read after running this general
executable? This would be more like the situation of running DP.EXE and
then loading an STR on demand. Do you have any idea on how this would
affect speed and/or memory usage? Would it be possible by writing
something on top of dpif.c? (My C knowledge is not so thorough to
immediately judge this, unfortunately.) The rationale behind my question
is that one general executable would make development easier.
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
10. This could be done, and should have very little effect on memory usage.
Each script would take a little bit more time to run because each one would
have to read the STR file before it began. By generating the pba.c offline,
this work is done only once.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
11. Am I correct in understanding that you need to recompile 
<ul>
<li>
after having performed an index regeneration (root index position
changes)
<li>
after adding/changing/removing a field definition (field definition
changes)
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
11. The pba.c file will need to be regenerated and recompiled whenever there
is a change to real fields or index definitions.
</p>

<p>
The question of root index positions is more delicate.
The METADXP program does not export the root index position information
from the STR file. 
Instead there is a report in METAD that assigns index base blocks in a
standard way.
After changing an index definition, you will need to delete the .IND file
and have DataPerfect recreate the index file and then recreate the indexes
for all panels.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
12. Is there any other reason apart from lack of time and/or effort that
it's been decided not to add userID checking yet?
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
12. This needs to be added in each CGI script where it is needed.
We have developed a few techniques for doing this and will document them
soon.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
13. Is the FORTH code in dot.c a subset of the code used to generate
DP.EXE?
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
13. No, it was developed independently, by the same author.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
14. In the case of G- and H-fields with decimals the procedure does not
produce correct results when the decimal point is NOT '.'. On the
European continent, we generally use '.' as thousands separator, and ','
as the decimal 'point'. When following the pba.c generation procedure as
it currently is, a 'GZ.ZZ9,99', would contain 6 decimals, while we
Europeans would expect 2. This information is correctly stored in the
STR, but not read by the metadxp.com program. Panel 1 of the metad
database has the '.'  hardcoded in the field formula for P3F28. This
then creates errors in the generated pba.c files.
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
14. You are correct.
The METAD database will need some changes to handle this.
Also, the function <code>FSformatG</code> will need to be improved.
</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
15. Is there a simpler way to display data from just one
panel to the web? It would be great if a user of my
library automation program could display a library
catalog (i.e., the data from the "Library Catalog"
panel) on the web. I took a brief look at the
Firestorm site but it seems technically over my head...
I don't know anything about C or Perl programming and
only a rough idea of how cgi scripts work.
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
15. sanbachs.NET offers a <a href=hosting.html>hosting service</a> that may
be of interest.
</p>

<p><a name=16><strong>Question</strong></a>
16. We share a rather large DP application with passwords (3 levels - one to
change structure and two to read/write).  We would like to write and read in
this DP using Firestorm, but how do we have to deal with these passwords?
</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>
16. Firestorm coordinates data access, using the index and data files together in a manner that is compatible with DataPerfect. However, it does nothing special with passwords, keep-a-total, formulas, etc.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, on the web there is no notion of session.
With DataPerfect, each user is running the DP client software on their own workstations.
Browsers do not maintain any information about what the user is doing, or who they are, from one web page request to another.
</p>

<p>
Here is how I have dealt with passwords.
</p>

<p>
A DP application with passwords will usually have a USER_ID panel.
For example, this might be panel 43.
To this panel, add two fields, one for an IP address and one for a timestamp.
For example, these might be fields 4 and 5 of the USER_ID panel.
Also, add a new index using field 1 and the IP address.
Then, in each CGI script, call a function like the following:
</p>

<pre>
 1 int authenticate(Field_Value *ID, Field_Value *IP)
 2 {
 3   FS_panel p43;
 4   char AuthTime[15];
 5   time_t authTime, now;
 6   Field_Value *nowTime;
 7
 8   p43 = FSsetPanel(43);
 9   if ((FSequalRec(p43,FSifList(p43,2,ID,IP))) != FS_OK) {
10     return 0;
11   } else {
12     authTime = atol(FSfield(p43,5)->field_data);
13     time(&now);
14     if ((now-authTime) <= 1800) { /* one half hour of inactivity */
15       sprintf(AuthTime,"%ld",now);
16       nowTime = NewField('3',5,strlen(AuthTime),AuthTime);
17       FSupdateField(p43, FSifList(p43,2,ID,IP), 5, ':', nowTime);
18       return 1;
19     }
20     return 0;
21   }
23 }
</pre>

<p>
Pass the user id from web page to web page.
This can be done either using hidden fields in each form, or by a technique
called "URL stuffing" which includes it in each URL.
In each CGI script, call the function defined in line 1 early and if it fails
(returns zero) invite the user to login again.
Authentication can fail for two reasons.
In line 10 it fails because there is no record for the user and IP address.
In line 20 it fails because the user has been inactive for over 1800 seconds.
In line 17 the function updates the record to the current time.
</p>

<p>
To start the authentication process, use code like the following right
after the user has logged in:
</p>

<pre>
 1 time(&now);
 2 sprintf(AuthTime,"%ld",now);
 3 nowTime = NewField('3',5,strlen(AuthTime),AuthTime);
 4 FSupdateField(p43, FSifList(p43,1,ID), 4, ':', IP);
 5 FSupdateField(p43, FSifList(p43,1,ID), 5, ':', nowTime);
</pre>

<p>
This gets the current time as a long integer (line 1),
converts it to a character string (line 2),
creates a new field value from this string (line 3),
stores the IP address in the USER_ID panel (line 4),
and stores the current time in the USER_ID panel (line 5).
