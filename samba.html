<h1>Firestorm – Samba</h1>

<p>
[ This is an adaptation of a message posted to the DP users group
mailing list on Tuesday, December 12, 2000 by Brian Hancock. ]
</p>

<h2>Aim</h2>
To access a DP application running on a Novell LAN, to provide some
information to the general public via a web browser across the internet.

<h2>Issues</h2>
<ol>
<li>
My client's LAN is full-time connected to the internet by a dial up modem
connection, and is protected from the outside world by a very basic router
and NAT, Network Address Translation.
<li>
My client's web pages are located on a web host exterior to my client's
network.
<li>
The web host although allowing Perl scripts to run on the server will not
allow C programs like the Firestorm executables.
<li>
My client uses a DP application for various purposes, and the sort of
public would require will be order status information or
courier consignment information, both of which are available within the DP
application. At present clients will phone in and a client service person
will check the database and give them the information over the phone.
<li>
They have a single Novell server, and for security reasons they would not
be happy with any exterior access directly to this box.
<li>
They want a relatively inexpensive solution.
</ol>
<p>
This sort of scenario is probably not uncommon to a lot of people.
<p>
<h2>Progress</h2>
I decided to use Linux as the platform for providing CGI scripting and to
execute the Firestorm application. I have a number of reasons for this but
they all primarily relate to cost. For a start Linux gives me a web server,
and even a C compiler together with the operating system for very little
cost, and it can be implemented on low end PC hardware. I have not used
Linux or Unix before so I am going through a learning curve, and any Linux
people out there will readily be able to point to my various deficiencies.
<p>
Getting Firstorm to work on the Linux box was no problem. By following the
instructions on the 
<a href=usage.html>usage</a>
of Firestorm
you will get a C source code.
The pba.c file is created by the Metad application which you can download.
Metadxp.com is used to create a file based on its analysis of the target
databases .STR file. This file is imported into a DP Metad database, and
after a little massaging through various reports creates a pba.c file. The
second part of this process is compiling the resultant file and linking it
with a number of object files, as detailed in the Firestorm usage
instructions and you are left with an executable program. This executable
program expects the .STR, IND, .TXX and panel file to be in the same folder.
To test it out I just copied the target DP application to the Linux box and
ran the exectuable program using the 
<a href=cli.html>command line interface</a>.

<p>
At this point there are two ways to go, instead of having the DP application
sitting on the Netware server I could have moved its files to the Linux
server. However I wanted them to be safely tucked away on the Novell Netware
server.
<p>
At home where I am doing this work I do not have a Netware server, but I do
have a WinNT box, as well as Win95/98 machines. So my first step has been to
look at Samba.
<p>
Samba is the name used to provide Microsoft Networking service to the Linux
environment. You can set Linux up to either mimic a Microsoft Network server
or client. The configuration of the server is reasonably complicated. The
Samba server is started by executing 
<pre>
  smb start
</pre>
and it uses the smb.conf
file to define shares, permission and other security. The Samba client by
contrast is much easier to set up, and you do not need the Samba server to
be running.. In its simplest form to gain access to a Win95/98 share is very
easy, the command line 
<pre>
  smbclient  // ComputerName/ShareName  password
</pre>

gives
you an FTP like prompt for accessing the Windows share. However this is not
that useful for what I want to do.
<p>
An alternative is the smbmount command which mounts the Windows share as
though it were a directory on the Linux box. To use this it was necessary to
create an empty folder on the Linux box and then to issue the command:

<pre>
  smbmount   // ComputerName/ShareName /LinuxFolder name
</pre>
For example I
created
a folder with in the /mnt folder named WinPC1 and issued the command

<pre>
  smbmount  // WinPC1/MyApp /mnt/WinPC1
</pre>
after which I entered the password.
You only need a read-only share if you do not wish Firestorm to modify, add
or delete any data, but just display it. Read-only is fine for me because it
give that little bit extra security. At this point the /mnt/WinPC1 folder
appears in the Linux file structure, except that the files are on a remote
machine, but you would never know, it just looks like a normal Linux folder
unless you were to check it properties.
<p>
I then copied Firestorm executable created after compiling the pba.c source
and copied it on to the Windows machine in the same folder as the rest of
the application, and it worked fine. (I termporarily made my share Full
Access to do this).
<p>
I have been very happy with the results.
<p>
The next stage for me is to find a Novell client for Linux, there are a
number of clients around for this purpose however I think most of them only
work in Bindery emulation mode, and not the full NDS (Netware Directory
Services) however Novell is soon to release a full blown Linux client and I
am hoping that it has a similar functionality to the smbmount (Samba mount
client).
<p>
After  that I will write the HTML, and CGI programs, but I do not
expect that to be difficult.
<p>
<h2>Security</h2>
Letting the outside world onto your network is not necessarily a great thing
to do.  I have been using a very inexpensive ACER dial up internet router.
It provides NAT service so that you have private IP addressing on your LAN,
and that is translated into the public address of the router before sending
off to the internet. The external server returns the request to the router's
IP address and NAT resolves it back to the requesting computer on the
private network.  The ACER router/modem has a Virtual Server configration
where you can route requests made to the a specific port on the routers
public IP address and route them to a computer on the internal network.
<p>
My clients web pages will still be able to reside on the external web host,
however for the CGI requests for information from the DataPerfect
application I can direct it to our own network.For CGI I can set the router
to take all requests on port 80 (ie HTTP) and transfer them to the Linux
box, and the Apache server will process the request using script set up to
use Firestorm. These CGI script will be pointed to the Linux server on the
clients network rather than back to the web hosts computer, although it may
be possible for me to use the CGI from their server which would totally hide
the access to the client network from the web client. Using the router to
only accept Port 80 means the other services on the network are effectively
blocked from public access. I certainly wouldn't recommend this on network
with highly sensitive data. After setting up such a system you might like to
point a browser on the internal private network to 
<a href=http://www.grc.com>http://www.grc.com</a>
where
you can have your network tested for points of vulnerability. If the only
point of contact open is port 80, when you do that test, you can probably
rest reasonably easily.
<p>
(As a point of aside try the 
<a href=http://www.grc.com>http://www.grc.com</a>
on your normal dial up or
cable connection when you are not using a router and you may be surprised
what things the outside world can see on your computer)
<p>
I will keep everyone updated on how the project pans out. Once the technical
issues are done I still have to convince my client that this is a good idea,
so it may be some time before it goes public.
