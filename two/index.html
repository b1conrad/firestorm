<H1>Firestorm Two</H1>
<P>
With Firestorm Two, you can
use DataPerfect to create a dynamic browser-based application.
This is based on the latest version of DataPerfect,
DP2.6x
(available <A HREF="dp26x.zip">here</A>).
</P>
<P>
In a browser-based application, the user experience with the
application takes place on a <B>user machine</B> running browser software.
Possible browsers include Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, Opera,
Netscape Communicator, and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
The application itself is a DataPerfect application which
is connected to webserver software that runs on a <B>server machine</B>.
</P>
<P>
As described in the possible configurations, it is possible for the
<B>server machine</B> to be either:
<UL>
<LI>the same machine as the <B>user machine</B>,</LI>
<LI>a server on a LAN,</LI>
<LI>or a server on the Internet.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><U>Possible Configurations</U></H2>
<H3>Single Machine</H3>
<P>
This single machine will be both the 
<B>user machine</B> and the <B>server machine</B>.
You will need to have rights to download and install software on this machine.
</P>
<H3>Local Area Network (LAN)</H3>
<P>
One machine on the LAN will be the <B>server machine</B>.
Ideally, this should be the same machine on which the database files reside.
This machine, and any other machine on the LAN, can be the <B>user machine</B>.
You will need to have rights to copy new versions of the database
onto the server machine.
</P>
<H3>The Internet</H3>
<P>
A machine on the Internet will be the <B>server machine</B>.
You will need to have rights to upload and run CGI scripts on this machine.
Any machine with an Internet connection, anywhere in the world,
can be the <B>user machine</B>.
</P>
<H2><U>Software Installation</U></H2>
<P>
Once you have identified the <B>server machine</B>,
you will need to install and configure webserver software.
One possibility for Windows operating systems is the
<A HREF=http://www.keyfocus.net/kfws/>KF Web Server</A>.
For Linux machines, consider
<A HREF=http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/>Apache</A>.
</P>
<P>
On the same machine as the webserver, you will need the FS2 executable program
(available <A HREF="javascript:alert('Not yet available');void 0">here</A>),
and the DPWEB database files
(available <A HREF="DPWEB.STE">here</A>).
You will need to configure the webserver software to associate
the FS2 executable program with the ".STR" filename extension.
</P>
<P>
Create your application database, and make entries in the
DPWEB database to describe your application.
You can do this either directly with DataPerfect, or through
the DPWEB browser-based application
(which is, itself, implemented as a Firestorm Two application).
</P>
<H2><U>Security and Multi-user Considerations</U></H2>
<P>
An initial design document is 
<A HREF=DPWEB.rtf>available for comment</A>.
A <A HREF=tutorial/index.html>tutorial</A> on the initial design
of the DPWEB database is also available for comment.
