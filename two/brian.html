Subject: A sample DP Dynamic Web application
Date: Mon, 15 Nov 2004 18:02:30 +1100

Hi Everyone,

I can't wait till the next version of DP comes out, with even more web
functionality than it now has. I did a presentation for the Assocation of
WordPerfect Professionals last month, and I have updated the presentation
material including a totally database driven web application.  You can
download the presentation and the sample application from my web site at
<a href=http://www.brileigh.com/awpp>http://www.brileigh.com/awpp</a>

I haven't resolved permission issues with my web host, so I can't show you a
live website, however there are instructions on how to set up your own
Apache web server and PERL Far easier that you would think. About 30 minutes
work.  It will look and feel and work like a fully blown web app. (Ok maybe
with some rough edges as this is version 1.0)

I think the sample application will perhaps inspire you to have a go at it,
and that you too will have the enthusiam for the the work Lew, Thom and
Bruce have been doing with DataPerfect in regards to DP in a silent mode.
They are giving DP a huge new lease of life.

The concept is relatively easy, I showed a web designer how it works
yesterday, and he seemed enthused about how easy and powerful it seemed.

The PERL script I have written are very generic, and you will probably be
able to run them as is for many applications. The script are commented with
the changes you will need to make. There are not many - mainly to do with
the name of the .STR file, and which numbered report you wish to run. This
is my first substantial PERL exercise, so anyone with some PERL skill who
would like to add a bit a polish to it please do so.

I have set up, a few different sorts of reports. Some just viewing data,
other editing, or adding. records. There is a fairly standard methodology to
it all.

Getting the web page pretties in it is actually  very easy. If you are not
artistically minded, and I am certainly not, you might find that a
connection with a web designer will pay dividends. Let him/her create the
web pages, and then tell you where you can put data. Probaby the easiest way
is to embed a table with a head row and one one row and some sample data.
For this sample I just randomly picked a website, and "stole" their
pretties. I promised I will never use it in anything other than a demo.

To start off to see how easy it is, Create a DP report on the data panel.
Open the webpage that you have written  in a text editor, and remove leading
space from each line, and copy everything you want up to the header row of
the table into the First Page Header. (Bring DP into a window, place cursor
in the First Page Header field, and then System Menu - Edit-Paste).
Similarly copy the  table row into the Report Body, and then Copy the
</Table> closing and everything from their on into the Final Footer. Go back
to the Report Body and replace your dummy data with fields from the DP
panel. Have the Report save the file to disk, with a .HTM extension.  Run
the report and this will product a static webpage as a file on disk.

The reports in the Zango application are a little more complex. But they
look worse than they are. In summary.  If you are not sure how it all works,
play around, with the sample application. Back everything up, before you
tamper with it.

A couple of gotchas to watch out for.

1. PERL is not very friendly to read or to get diagnostic information from
2. You will be calling reports by their numbered position from the Report
List, (Built In Short Report) is No.1
3. Be careful you do not accidentally delete a report, otherwise all the
other reports with shift down. Actually I have used a Report Variable RV1 to
number the Report, and my Browser Control Panel (Param.dat) has a field with
the report number so that you can check which report is supposed to be
running
4. In my sample, the structure is. Report based on desired Panel. Virtual
Sub Report  the Browser Control Panel (BCP) to get My Session ID linked by
Report Number in RV1.Immediately after that another Virtual Sub report again
to the  BCP linked on RV1 (Report Numbe) and RV2 (SessionID) but this time
it is to lift off the Parameters for the Report if any,  After that
subreport exits another Virtual Sub Report to the same BCP Panel linked
again by Report Number and SessionID to delete all the Parameters.  Yep
thats 3 Virtual Subreport in a row back to trhe same panel.
4a. There is a multiuser issue to be aware of which hopefully will be
addressed by features in the next version of DP. (I hope I am not being
presumptuous Lew).  The Synthetic Transaction log, imports the Form field
and values in the BCP. At the moment, I do not know who owns that data. (A
global variable passed from a Command Line Switch working in a similar
manner to the UserID variable will make life much easier, and will eliminate
the first pass Virtual SubReport thru the BCP). At the moment a race
condition exists where for perhaps as much as a couple of seconds, where
multiuser access against the same report will be a problem.
4b. Ok back to the structure. Another subreport can be used but this time to
the real data panels, where data manipulation can occur, eg updating data,
deleting data, creating new records etc. Then sraight after that, a Virtual
SubReport to the Panel that is holding the data for the resultant webpage.
Its in this subreport that you copy the webpage as described above for
statis webpages. Stop the Report as soon as that subreport exits.

It may sound complicated, but once you have the structure things will just
fall into place.

5. Oh yeah one other big gotcha..  I exported an STE so I could do some
shortcut changes to a report. I reimported the STE, but forgot to start DP
up interactively. DP needs to regenerate indexes after a full STE import,
and that only happens interactively. I ran the Web application before doing
that, and DP does not end very elegantly. Remember to do system maintenance
first in interactive mode.!!!

Enjoy

Brian
